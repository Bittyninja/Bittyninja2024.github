    <p><b>Graphic design</b> is a profession,<sup>[2]</sup>academic discipline   
        <sup>[3]</sup><sup>[4]</sup><sup></sup><sup>[5]</sup>and applied art 
        whose  activity consists in projecting visual communications intended to 
        transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific objectives.
        <sup>[6]</sup> Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of design
        <sup>[1]</sup> and of the fine arts.Its practice involves creativity, 
        innovation and lateral thinking using manual or digital tools, where it 
        is usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually.</p><p>The 
            role of the graphic designer in the communication process is that of
             encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the 
             interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages.
              Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and the
               compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery 
               to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language 
               alone expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's 
               demand, a demand that ends up being established linguistically, 
               either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design 
               transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.
               <sup>[7]</sup></p><p>Graphic design has, as a field of
                 application, different areas of knowledge focused on any
                  visual communication system. For example, it can be applied 
                  in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied in the
                   aviation world[8] or space exploration.<sup>[9]</sup><sup>
                    [10]</sup> In this sense, in some countries graphic design 
                    is related as only associated with the production of 
                    sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual 
                    communication is a small part of a huge range of types and 
                    classes where it can be applied.</p><p>With origins in 
                        Antiquity and the Middle Ages,<sup>[11]</sup> graphic 
                        design as applied art was initially linked to the boom 
                        of rise of printing in Europe in the 15th century and 
                        the growth of consumer culture in the Industrial
                         Revolution. From there it emerged as a distinct 
                         profession in the West, closely associated with 
                         advertising in the 19th century<sup>[12]</sup> and its 
                         evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century.
                         Given the rapid and massive growth in information 
                         exchange today, the demand for experienced designers 
                         is greater than ever, particularly because of the 
                         development of new technologies and the need to pay 
                         attention to human factors beyond the competence of 
                         the engineers who develop them.<sup>[13]</sup></p>

                             often credited with first using the term "graphic
                              design" in a 1922 article,[14] although it appears 
                              in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of 
                              Organized Labor, a publication of the Labor Unions 
                              of San Francisco, in an article about technical

                                 which prevails among printers is an assurance 
                                 that with the elemental principles of design at 
                                 their finger ends many of them will grow in 
                                 knowledge and develop into specialists in 
                                 graphic design and decorating. …</p><p>A decade

                                      California School of Arts & Crafts
                                       advertised a course titled Graphic
