                Thomas is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. He is happy, alert, and very 
                playful. He is a great pet for people of all ages. He is  
                intelligent and willing to please. He is housed trained and 
                knows how to shake, roll over, and fetch. He is a good watchdog 
                and will either be very noisy or very cautious with strangers.

                    Ziva is a good-natured dog, and she is very eager to please. 
                    Shelties are easy to train. She will make an amazing 
                    playmate for children and can sometimes be timid and 
                    standoffish with strangers. She has a big and beautiful 
                    coat that requires daily grooming. She will make a great 
                    addition to your home.

                    It may be in their nature to chase birds, but they are  
                    also happy taking long walks in the woods or just hanging 
                    out with their loving humans. Animated, intuitive, and 
                    generally cheerful, these small dogs make wonderful 
                    therapy pets. Cavaliers do well in families with older 
                    children who will play outside with them and give them 
                    much-needed exercise. We are asking that Lady and Luna be 
                    adopted together.
